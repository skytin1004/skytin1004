Localization should be infrastructure, not a project.

I build GitHub-native multilingual automation infrastructure.

## Why I’m Working on Localization

Localization fails not because AI is weak,
but because it becomes operational overhead.

I’m building infrastructure that removes that burden.

Translations should be treated as versioned software artifacts not static outputs.
